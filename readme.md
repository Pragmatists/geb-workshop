# Geb workshop

This is the code repository for a workshop showing how to use the [Geb library](http://www.gebish.org/) to write automated end-to-end web tests that use a real browser to communicate with your applicaton.

It's organized by tags - you clone the master branch, and then checkout the appropriate tag. They are named according to the pattern `<digit><digit>-<description>` (for example, `01-basic`). The numbers represent the intended order in which they should be studied.
